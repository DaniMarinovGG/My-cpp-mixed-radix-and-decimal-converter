# My-cpp-mixed-radix-and-decimal-converter
This is a program that converts numbers in the decimal positional number system to numbers in your custom made "mixed-base" (mixed-radix) positional number system and the other way around. So go ahead and pls follow the instructions :) and plug in some non-negative integers in there and see what happens I guess...
